  ```

  ```
  python3 -m pip --version
  ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment: 
  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
4. Install and run `elb-doctor` package: 
  ```
  python3 -m pip install elb-doctor
  elbdoc
  ```

## Manually get started 
1. Clone this repo
2. (Optional)Create a virtual python environment following the guide [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
3. Install AWS SDK boto3 and PyInquirer: 
  ```

  ```
4. Run the `__main__.py` manually to start the wizard:
