# ELB Doctor

Sometimes troubleshooting AWS ELB can be very difficult and intimidating due to the complexity of virtual cloud network and various ELB types/features. Navigating in multi-layered AWS console to look for a clue is not an easy task either and could often be time consuming. This tool provides a no-brainer CLI wizard to help you check ELB basics, display target group health status and potentially identify the root cause.

## Install using pip(NOT published yet)
1. Ensure you can run Python from the command line. You should get some output like Python 3.X.X. 
  ```

  ```
2. Additionally, youâ€™ll need to make sure you have pip available. You can check this by running:
  ```
  python3 -m pip --version
  ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment: 
  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
4. Install and run `elb-doctor`:
